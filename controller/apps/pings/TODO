class Ping
----------
As seems that there is only one content_type value maybe we can avoid
using a generic relation that is less efficient?

This is false, at least there are pings to MgmtNetConf (nodes, hosts)
and pings to MgmtIface (slivers).

Is there any way to optimize generic relations on Postgres?
